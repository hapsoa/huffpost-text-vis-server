    "content": " KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Early results in Ukraine’s presidential election show a comedian with no political experience maintaining his strong lead against the incumbent president in the first round, setting the stage for a runoff in three weeks. With nearly 70 percent of the polling stations counted Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy had 30 percent of Sunday’s vote, while incumbent President Petro Poroshenko was a distant second with just over 16 percent. Ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko trailed behind with 13 percent. The results were in sync with a top exit poll. The strong showing for the 41-year-old Zelenskiy reflects the public longing for a fresh leader who has no links to the corruption-ridden Ukrainian political elite and can offer a new approach to settling the grinding five-year conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. “This is only the first step toward a great victory,” Zelenskiy said after seeing the exit poll findings. The top two candidates advance to a runoff on April 21. Final results in Sunday’s first round are expected to be announced later Monday. Zelenskiy dismissed suggestions that he could pool forces with Tymoshenko to get the backing of her voters in the second round in exchange for forming a coalition following parliamentary elections in the fall. “We aren’t making any deals with anyone,” he said. “We are young people. We don’t want to see all the past in our future, the future of our country.” Like the character he plays in a TV sitcom, a schoolteacher turned president, Zelenskiy made fighting corruption a focus of his candidacy. He proposed a lifetime ban on holding public office for anyone convicted of graft. He also called for direct negotiations with Russia on ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The election was marred by allegations of widespread vote buying. Police said they had received more than 2,100 complaints of violations on voting day alone in addition to hundreds of earlier voting fraud claims, including bribery attempts and removing ballots from polling places. Zelenskiy’s headquarters alleged multiple voting and other cheating on the part of Poroshenko’s campaign, but election officials said the vote took place without significant violations. “It is important for us to tell you that no systematic violations took place on either the election day or the night following the election when votes were being counted at the local polling stations,” said Central Election Commission head Tetyana Slipachuk. Poroshenko looked somber as the votes came in, but visibly relieved about surpassing Tymoshenko to advance to the runoff. “I critically and soberly understand the signal that society gave today to the acting authorities,” he said. “It’s a tough lesson for me and my team. It’s a reason for serious work to correct mistakes made over the past years.” It is not clear whether he would or could adjust his campaign enough to meet Zelenskiy’s challenges over the next three weeks. Poroshenko, 53, a confectionery tycoon before he was elected five years ago, saw approval of his governing sink amid Ukraine’s economic woes and a sharp plunge in living standards. Poroshenko campaigned on promises to defeat the rebels in the east and to wrest back control of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 in a move that has drawn sanctions against Russia from the U.S. and the European Union. A military embezzlement scheme that allegedly involved top Poroshenko associates, as well as a factory controlled by the president, dogged Poroshenko before this election. Ultra-right activists shadowed him throughout the campaign, demanding the jailing of the president’s associates accused in the scandal. Poroshenko after the vote hit back at Zelenskiy, describing him as a pawn of self-exiled billionaire businessman Igor Kolomoyskyi, charges that Zelenskiy denies. “Fate pitted me against Kolomoyskyi’s puppet in the runoff,” he said. “We won’t leave a single chance for Kolomoyskyi.” Zelenskiy quickly shot back, saying mockingly that it’s impossible to say whether a corrupt official involved in the military embezzlement scheme was Poroshenko’s puppet, or the other way round. With the lineup for the runoff becoming clear, voters were picking sides. “Poroshenko is taking the country forward,” said Serhiy Poltorachenko, a bank employee. “He made mistakes, but promised to correct them. Poroshenko will win because Ukrainians won’t like to have a clown at the country’s helm.” Petro Demidchenko, a 38-year-old office worker, said he was supporting Zelenskiy even though he is an unknown quantity. “We don’t know what to expect from Zelenskiy, but over the past five years we have found out what to expect from Poroshenko — corruption, soaring prices, continuing war and poverty,” he said.",

    "content": " DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — A leaking gas line exploded Wednesday in a Durham shopping district, killing one person and injuring more than a dozen others as firefighters were evacuating people from buildings near the rupture, authorities said. The blast reverberated across the North Carolina city — turning one building to rubble, shattering windows blocks away and filling the air with acrid smoke. Jim Rogalski, 58, was working in his office across the street from the destroyed building when the explosion blew out the windows. At least four people working in cubicles by the windows suffered deep cuts, bloody head wounds and other injuries, he said. “There was lots of screaming. ...” Rogalski said. “It was pretty frantic there for a little bit until help showed up.” Rogalski was seated one row away from the windows and wasn’t hurt. “It was terrifying,” he said. “The whole building shook. Things started falling — ceiling tiles, and structure and glass and debris. Lots and lots of dust. It was tough to see beyond 20 feet or so.” The explosion came about 15 minutes after the office’s human resources manager sent an email warning that the city’s fire department was investigating the smell of gas and that workers shouldn’t leave the building through the front door, he said as a friend gave him a ride home to Chapel Hill. Rogalski said he was forced to abandon his car in a nearby parking deck because authorities worried the blast may have weakened the structure. Durham Fire Chief Robert Zoldos said the blast at 10:07 a.m. involved five buildings on the block and catastrophically damaged one. The leak had been reported during construction a half-hour earlier, prompting the evacuations. On Wednesday afternoon, jagged beams jutted out of the collapsed building, along with bent sheet metal, bricks and wood. Its roof had completely fallen in, and the partly caved-in roof of an adjacent building cascaded into the rubble pile. A massive stream of water from a ladder truck sprayed onto the remnants, draining down the street as firefighters walked past. Now that the fires have been contained, crews will begin search and rescue operations, Zoldos said at a news conference. No one is unaccounted for, the chief said, but they’ll use dogs and listening devices to make sure no one is inside the rubble. A total of 17 people were seen at hospitals — six in critical condition and one transported to a burn center — Durham EMS Assistant Chief Lee Van Vleet said. Zoldos said one firefighter was seriously injured and in surgery but expected to recover. Zoldos said the cause of the explosion was still under investigation. A contractor boring under a sidewalk had hit a 2-inch (5-centimeter) gas line, causing the leak, Durham Police Department spokesman Wil Glenn said. Glenn linked the boring work to the explosion during a morning briefing, but Zoldos later said the cause was still under investigation. Dominion Energy said in a press release Wednesday that subsidiary company PSNC Energy had received a call about “third-party” damage to a natural gas line in Durham. A PSNC worker responded, and the explosion “occurred shortly thereafter.” The company said additional crews arrived and shut off the gas. Deputy City Manager Bo Ferguson said boring for a fiber communications network had been underway in the area, but city officials were working to confirm that and couldn’t release the name of the contractor. Blocks away, the blast shattered windows and blew at least one door off its hinges in the Brightleaf shopping district. Ed Rains was on a nearby street and couldn’t see the blast but heard it. “I thought someone had dropped a dumpster on the street,” he said. Tracy Telenko was at his desk in his third-floor Durham office when he heard the explosion and saw black smoke billowing up. “My first thought, because there was construction going on around my building, was something fell, somebody doing construction dropped something,” he said. Telenko said he went home after his boss told employees they could leave if they didn’t feel safe in their office. At nearby Durham School of the Arts, students were evacuated and classes dismissed for the day. Teacher Al Donaldson was walking through a hallway in a building about two blocks from the blast when he heard a loud noise, which concerned faculty and students. “We didn’t know the origin at the time,” he said. “I was in the hallway, so I didn’t so much feel it shake as experiencing a jarring sound.” The collapsed building is occupied by Prescient Co., which said in July 2017 that it was moving its headquarters from Arvada, Colorado, and expected to employ about 60 executives, engineering and sales workers in Durham. The company uses specialized software to design and build precise materials that allow builders to assemble multistory apartments, hotels and other commercial buildings faster and cheaper. ___ Emery P. Dalesio and Martha Waggoner in Raleigh; Tom Foreman Jr. in Charlotte; and Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia, contributed to this story. ___ This story has been edited to clarify that the explosion caused the entire roof of one building to cave in while the roof of an adjacent building partly collapsed.",

    "content": " President Donald Trump has finally dropped his ruse that China pays tariffs to the U.S. Instead, he emphasized another trade lie on Monday. Trump has repeatedly insisted that China pays tariffs directly to the U.S. government. But it’s actually U.S. importers who pay tariffs for Chinese goods, and they pass those costs to U.S. consumers in the form of higher product prices.  Trump finally appeared to concede in a tweet that Americans are the ones who really shoulder tariff costs. But he said “there is no reason” they have to pay them — as long as they buy from a “non-Tariffed Country.” Many American goods, however, contain parts from different countries, so it’s difficult to dodge products that aren’t affected by tariffs. Trump also said tariff costs can be avoided if products are purchased “inside the USA,” but that’s clearly not the case with products hit by tariffs — even if people buy them in the U.S. Trump also tweeted — again — that tariffs have helped the U.S. economy, which is not true according to his own economic adviser. “Some people just don’t get it!” Trump wrote. White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow conceded to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday that Trump’s tariffs have hurt jobs as well as GDP.  He estimates that loss to be about two-tenths of 1 percent of GDP — lower than many economists’ estimates — and called it a “very modest number” and “so small.” But The Washington Post noted that Kudlow’s estimate amounts to about $40 billion. In addition, trade fears sent global stock markets plunging Monday, wiping out $1 trillion in value around the world, Bloomberg reported. Kudlow also admitted to Wallace — despite Trump’s earlier claims — that Americans pay the costs of the tariffs. China announced Monday it will hike tariffs June 1 on $60 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation for the Trump administration’s increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods last week.",

    "content": " Coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19, has morphed into a global pandemic. Because the virus can be spread easily, many have resorted wearing face masks to protect themselves, as the virus is transmissible through human contact and exposure to respiratory droplets from an infected person.  But even though people are rushing to get their hands on a medical face mask, experts are somewhat skeptical about how effective they are in protecting people against dangerous viruses and bacteria. Below is their take on whether or not you should wear a mask and how else you can protect yourself. There are a couple different ways viruses such as this one can go around. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they expel respiratory droplets into the air that carry the virus. They can also spread those droplets around if they touch their eyes and nose then touch another person or surface. If someone were to come into contact with these contagious droplets — either in the air or by touching a surface that contained the droplets — they, too, could get sick.  There is some evidence that, when used correctly, face masks can slow the spread of airborne viruses. For example, one study from 2008 found that those who used a mask were 80% less likely to get the flu. Another 2009 report found that, in tandem with frequent hand-washing, face masks lowered people’s risk of getting the flu by about 70%. But the masks aren’t foolproof, and just because you’re wearing one does not mean you’re in the clear.  “Masks of any kind would be helpful because then they are covering up your nose and mouth so they aren’t going to touch those, but they still leave your eyes open so you can touch and transmit the virus that way,” Michael Ison, an infectious disease specialist with Northwestern Medicine, told HuffPost.  When we look back at the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that struck in 2003, researchers concluded that face masks played some role in slowing down the spread — especially in a hospital setting — but mostly because they prevented sick people from passing SARS around. In fact, most people in Asia wear the masks not to avoid getting sick themselves but to protect other people from harmful germs and viruses.  In 2012, when another deadly coronavirus — Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) — struck, health officials recommended wearing a face mask only if you were in the same room as a person with MERS. There just wasn’t enough evidence on if masks had any role in halting the spread of MERS.  The main takeaway here: Masks alone won’t eliminate your risk of contracting the coronavirus. But, they may help.  “It can reduce the risk of some transmissions, but doesn’t take the risk to zero,” Ison said. There are two types of face masks that can help cut your odds of getting coronavirus: Surgical face masks and respirators, also known as N-95 masks.  The ones we’re seeing all over the news? Those are surgical face masks, and what doctors, dentists and nurses use while treating patients.  While they do protect people from splashes and sprays to a degree, they aren’t foolproof. They’re loose-fitting and relatively thin, so tinier droplets can still seep in through the parts of the mask.  “[Surgical] masks do provide a degree of protection against fluids, including spray from a cough or sneeze, and they provide some filtration of the air. However, since the masks do not provide a tight seal around the wearer’s nose and mouth, much of the air inhaled and exhaled is unfiltered,” said Richard Martinello, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist.  Then, there are respirators, commonly used by construction workers. They’re heavy-duty, and are form fitted to your face. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , these masks filter out about 95% of airborne particles, including viruses and bacteria.  But, they aren’t so comfortable and many people report trouble breathing while wearing them, making them difficult to wear for hours on end. Respirators can get clogged and cause people’s breathing and heart rate to soar, so pregnant people or individuals with breathing problems should consult a doctor before using one.  It isn’t an essential need for everyone to wear face masks, according to the CDC. Many experts stress that the main point of them is to keep someone who is already sick from infecting others. “We generally do not recommend the use of either masks or respirators for the general public. Of course, persons who desire to be extra cautious about their exposure to germs when in public may choose to wear a mask,” Martinello said.  There are some exceptions: The World Health Organization urges that if you’re healthy, you should wear a mask if you’re taking care of a person suspected of having COVID-19. Neil Fishman, the chief medical officer of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, also told the New York Times that “for individuals working in certain essential industries, where they still have to go out every day, I think wearing a mask makes sense.” How well the masks work largely depends on if you’re is wearing it correctly. Make sure the correct side is facing outward, keep the mask snug over your nose, secure the loops behind your ears, and close off the gaps around your jawline. Martinello said the biggest mistake people make is when the mask covers their mouth but not their nose.  There are other steps you can take to keep yourself healthy. For one, keep a distance from sick people, especially those coughing or sneezing. Also, not touching your face with your hands minimizes your exposure to harmful germs.  Lastly, hand-washing is your best line of defense against any virus, so wash frequently and thoroughly. That means spending at least 20 seconds scrubbing your hands with soap and rinsing water.
