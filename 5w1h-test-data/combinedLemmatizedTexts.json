that china pay tariff to the u.s. instead, he emphasize another trade lie on monday. trump have repeatedly insist that china pay tariff directly to the u.s. government. but it ’ s actually u.s. importer who pay tariff for chinese good, and they pass those cost to u.s. consumer in the form of high product price. trump finally appear to concede in a tweet that american be the one who really shoulder tariff cost. but he say “ there be no reason ” they have to pay them — as long a they buy from a “ non-tariffed country. ” many american good, however, contain part from different country, so it ’ s difficult to dodge product that aren ’ t affect by tariff. trump also say tariff cost can be avoid if product be purchase “ inside the usa, ” but that ’ s clearly not the case with product hit by tariff — even if people buy them in the u.s. trump also tweet — again — that tariff have help the u.s. economy, which be not true accord to his own economic adviser. “ some people just don ’ t get it! ” trump write. white house chief economic adviser larry kudlow concede to chris wallace on fox news sunday that trump ’ s tariff have hurt job as well a gdp. he estimate that loss to be about two-tenths of 1 percent of gdp — low than many economist ’ estimate — and call it a “ very modest number ” and “ so small. ” but the washington post note that kudlow ’ s estimate amount to about $ 40 billion. in addition, trade fear send global stock market plunge monday, wipe out $ 1 trillion in value around the world, bloomberg report. kudlow also admit to wallace — despite trump ’ s earlier claim — that american pay the cost of the tariff. china announce monday it will hike tariff june 1 on $ 60 billion of u.s. import in retaliation for the trump administration ’ s increase tariff on $ 200 billion worth of chinese good last week.", " do face mask really protect you from get sick?. expert explain if medical face mask work against illness like the coronavirus. coronavirus, which cause the respiratory illness covid-19, have morph into a global pandemic. because the virus can be spread easily, many have resort wear face mask to protect themselves, a the virus be transmissible through human contact and exposure to respiratory droplet from an infected person. but even though people be rush to get their hand on a medical face mask, expert be somewhat skeptical about how effective they be in protect people against dangerous virus and bacteria. below be their take on whether or not you should wear a mask and how else you can protect yourself. there be a couple different way virus such a this one can go around. when an infected person cough or sneeze, they expel respiratory droplet into the air that carry the virus. they can also spread those droplet around if they touch their eye and nose then touch another person or surface. if someone be to come into contact with these contagious droplet — either in the air or by touch a surface that contain the droplet — they, too, could get sick. there be some evidence that, when use correctly, face mask can slow the spread of airborne virus. for example, one study from 2008 find that those who use a mask be 80 % less likely to get the flu. another 2009 report find that, in tandem with frequent hand-washing, face mask lower people ’ s risk of get the flu by about 70 %. but the mask aren ’ t foolproof, and just because you ’ re wear one do not mean you ’ re in the clear. “ mask of any kind would be helpful because then they be cover up your nose and mouth so they aren ’ t go to touch those, but they still leave your eye open so you can touch and transmit the virus that way, ” michael ison, an infectious disease specialist with northwestern medicine, tell huffpost. when we look back at the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) epidemic that struck in 2003, researcher conclude that face mask play some role in slow down the spread — especially in a hospital set — but mostly because they prevent sick people from pass sars around. in fact, most people in asia wear the mask not to avoid get sick themselves but to protect other people from harmful germ and virus. in 2012, when another deadly coronavirus — middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) — strike, health official recommend wear a face mask only if you be in the same room a a person with mers. there just wasn ’ t enough evidence on if mask have any role in halt the spread of mers. the main takeaway here : mask alone win ’ t eliminate your risk of contract the coronavirus. but, they may help. “ it can reduce the risk of some transmission, but doesn ’ t take the risk to zero, ” ison say. there be two type of face mask that can help cut your odds of get coronavirus : surgical face mask and respirator, also know a n-95 mask. the one we ’ re see all over the news? those be surgical face mask, and what doctor, dentist and nurse use while treat patient. while they do protect people from splash and spray to a degree, they aren ’ t foolproof. they ’ re loose-fitting and relatively thin, so tiny droplet can still seep in through the part of the mask. “ [ surgical ] mask do provide a degree of protection against fluid, include spray from a cough or sneeze, and they provide some filtration of the air. however, since the mask do not provide a tight seal around the wearer ’ s nose and mouth, much of the air inhale and exhale be unfiltered, ” say richard martinello, a yale medicine infectious disease specialist. then, there be respirator, commonly use by construction worker. they ’ re heavy-duty, and be form fit to your face. accord to the center for disease control and prevention, these mask filter out about 95 % of airborne particle, include virus and bacteria. but, they aren ’ t so comfortable and many people report trouble breathe while wear them, make them difficult to wear for hour on end. respirator can get clog and cause people ’ s breathing and heart rate to soar, so pregnant people or individual with breathe problem should consult a doctor before use one. it isn ’ t an essential need for everyone to wear face mask, accord to the cdc. many expert stress that the main point of them be to keep someone who be already sick from infect others. “ we generally do not recommend the use of either mask or respirator for the general public. of course, person who desire to be extra cautious about their exposure to germ when in public may choose to wear a mask, ” martinello say. there be some exception : the world health organization urge that if you ’ re healthy, you should wear a mask if you ’ re take care of a person suspect of have covid-19. neil fishman, the chief medical officer of the hospital of the university of pennsylvania, also tell the new york time that “ for individual work in certain essential industry, where they still have to go out every day, i think wear a mask make sense. ” how well the mask work largely depend on if you ’ re be wear it correctly. make sure the correct side be face outward, keep the mask snug over your nose, secure the loop behind your ear, and close off the gap around your jawline. martinello say the big mistake people make be when the mask cover their mouth but not their nose. there be other step you can take to keep yourself healthy. for one, keep a distance from sick people, especially those cough or sneeze. also, not touch your face with your hand minimize your exposure to harmful germ. lastly, hand-washing be your best line of defense against any virus, so wash frequently and thoroughly. that mean spending at least 20 second scrub your hand with soap and rinsing water. this story have be update to reflect new information about the spread of the coronavirus."]
