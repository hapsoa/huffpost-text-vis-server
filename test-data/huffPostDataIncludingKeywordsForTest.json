[{"category": "WORLD NEWS", "content": " KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Early results in Ukraine’s presidential election show a comedian with no political experience maintaining his strong lead against the incumbent president in the first round, setting the stage for a runoff in three weeks. With nearly 70 percent of the polling stations counted Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy had 30 percent of Sunday’s vote, while incumbent President Petro Poroshenko was a distant second with just over 16 percent. Ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko trailed behind with 13 percent. The results were in sync with a top exit poll. The strong showing for the 41-year-old Zelenskiy reflects the public longing for a fresh leader who has no links to the corruption-ridden Ukrainian political elite and can offer a new approach to settling the grinding five-year conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. “This is only the first step toward a great victory,” Zelenskiy said after seeing the exit poll findings. The top two candidates advance to a runoff on April 21. Final results in Sunday’s first round are expected to be announced later Monday. Zelenskiy dismissed suggestions that he could pool forces with Tymoshenko to get the backing of her voters in the second round in exchange for forming a coalition following parliamentary elections in the fall. “We aren’t making any deals with anyone,” he said. “We are young people. We don’t want to see all the past in our future, the future of our country.” Like the character he plays in a TV sitcom, a schoolteacher turned president, Zelenskiy made fighting corruption a focus of his candidacy. He proposed a lifetime ban on holding public office for anyone convicted of graft. He also called for direct negotiations with Russia on ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The election was marred by allegations of widespread vote buying. Police said they had received more than 2,100 complaints of violations on voting day alone in addition to hundreds of earlier voting fraud claims, including bribery attempts and removing ballots from polling places. Zelenskiy’s headquarters alleged multiple voting and other cheating on the part of Poroshenko’s campaign, but election officials said the vote took place without significant violations. “It is important for us to tell you that no systematic violations took place on either the election day or the night following the election when votes were being counted at the local polling stations,” said Central Election Commission head Tetyana Slipachuk. Poroshenko looked somber as the votes came in, but visibly relieved about surpassing Tymoshenko to advance to the runoff. “I critically and soberly understand the signal that society gave today to the acting authorities,” he said. “It’s a tough lesson for me and my team. It’s a reason for serious work to correct mistakes made over the past years.” It is not clear whether he would or could adjust his campaign enough to meet Zelenskiy’s challenges over the next three weeks. Poroshenko, 53, a confectionery tycoon before he was elected five years ago, saw approval of his governing sink amid Ukraine’s economic woes and a sharp plunge in living standards. Poroshenko campaigned on promises to defeat the rebels in the east and to wrest back control of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 in a move that has drawn sanctions against Russia from the U.S. and the European Union. A military embezzlement scheme that allegedly involved top Poroshenko associates, as well as a factory controlled by the president, dogged Poroshenko before this election. Ultra-right activists shadowed him throughout the campaign, demanding the jailing of the president’s associates accused in the scandal. Poroshenko after the vote hit back at Zelenskiy, describing him as a pawn of self-exiled billionaire businessman Igor Kolomoyskyi, charges that Zelenskiy denies. “Fate pitted me against Kolomoyskyi’s puppet in the runoff,” he said. “We won’t leave a single chance for Kolomoyskyi.” Zelenskiy quickly shot back, saying mockingly that it’s impossible to say whether a corrupt official involved in the military embezzlement scheme was Poroshenko’s puppet, or the other way round. With the lineup for the runoff becoming clear, voters were picking sides. “Poroshenko is taking the country forward,” said Serhiy Poltorachenko, a bank employee. “He made mistakes, but promised to correct them. Poroshenko will win because Ukrainians won’t like to have a clown at the country’s helm.” Petro Demidchenko, a 38-year-old office worker, said he was supporting Zelenskiy even though he is an unknown quantity. “We don’t know what to expect from Zelenskiy, but over the past five years we have found out what to expect from Poroshenko — corruption, soaring prices, continuing war and poverty,” he said.", "date": "2019-04-01", "dateIndex": 0, "subtitle": "The strong showing reflects the public longing for a fresh leader who has no links to the corruption-ridden Ukrainian political elite.", "title": "Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Who Plays Ukraine's President On TV, Is Leading Election", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ukraine-comedian-leads-presidential-election-runoff-likely_n_5ca156fbe4b0bc0dacaa8268", "keywordObjects": [{"keyword": "zelenskiy", "weight": 0.0176771}, {"keyword": "poroshenko", "weight": 0.016414443}, {"keyword": "with", "weight": 0.013889127}, {"keyword": "election", "weight": 0.012626469}, {"keyword": "that", "weight": 0.010101156}, {"keyword": "have", "weight": 0.010101156}, {"keyword": "vote", "weight": 0.010101156}, {"keyword": "president", "weight": 0.008838499}, {"keyword": "ukraine", "weight": 0.008838499}, {"keyword": "runoff", "weight": 0.0075758416}]}, {"category": "U.S. NEWS", "content": " Another racehorse has died at Santa Anita Park, the famed thoroughbred racetrack outside Los Angeles, following a two-horse spill on Sunday. The fatality brings the equine death toll at the track to 23 since Dec. 26 — an unusually high number at a facility once considered among the safest in the sport.  Arms Runner, a 5-year-old horse owned by Rockingham Ranch, suffered a severe and ultimately fatal injury to his right front leg when he fell during the Grade 3 $100,000 San Simeon Stakes, NBC Los Angeles reported. The incident caused a trailing horse to also tumble, but that animal quickly rose to its feet without apparent injuries. Santa Anita Park had just reopened on Friday after the deaths of 22 horses at the racetrack prompted a weekslong suspension. Prior to the resumption of races, The Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita, had announced that it was taking the unprecedented step of banning race-day medication as well as introducing several new regulations, like demanding complete transparency of all veterinary records, in an effort to protect racehorses from harm. “The sport of horse racing is the last great sporting legacy platform to be modernized. If we expect our sport to grow for future generations, we must raise our standards,” Belinda Stronach, president of The Stronach Group, said in a statement. She added that the new initiatives represented a “seismic shift” in how the sport was conducted. “First and foremost, we must do right by the horse. When we do right by the horse, everything ― everything ― will follow,” Stronach said. Racegoers breathed a “sigh of relief” on Friday after the first race day back ended with zero deaths, the Los Angeles Times reported. “The public is probably a little shell-shocked at what’s going on. We’ve gotten a lot of bad exposure from everywhere. We’re going to need to go a long time without having something horrible happen,” a horse owner told the Times as she watched the races. Arms Runner died two days later. Most of the equine deaths at Santa Anita since December ― including Arms Runner’s ― have occurred on the dirt surface of the track, The Associated Press reported. However, when officials inspected and renovated the dirt surface last month, they said they found no issues with it.  Santa Anita’s equine death toll was significantly higher this year than in years prior. From December 2017 to February 2018, 10 horses died at the racetrack, per NBC Los Angeles. Over the same period in 2016-2017, the toll was eight.", "date": "2019-04-01", "dateIndex": 0, "subtitle": "The famed racetrack outside Los Angeles has come under scrutiny in recent weeks following an unusually high number of equine deaths.", "title": "Santa Anita Park Horse Death Toll Rises To 23", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/santa-anita-racetrack-23-horses-dead_n_5ca160efe4b0474c08d0956c", "keywordObjects": [{"keyword": "horse", "weight": 0.024830945}, {"keyword": "death", "weight": 0.018058838}, {"keyword": "have", "weight": 0.015801473}, {"keyword": "anita", "weight": 0.015801473}, {"keyword": "santa", "weight": 0.015801473}, {"keyword": "sport", "weight": 0.013544105}, {"keyword": "angeles", "weight": 0.013544105}, {"keyword": "stronach", "weight": 0.01128674}, {"keyword": "toll", "weight": 0.01128674}, {"keyword": "race", "weight": 0.01128674}]}, {"category": "WORLD NEWS", "content": " Against the backdrop of a Conservative Party leadership race and talk of a looming general election, members of parliament (MPs) will on Monday hold a second round of so-called “indicative” votes on alternatives to Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal. It is widely expected the option most likely to get a House of Commons majority is for a customs union — a much softer Brexit than the one offered by the prime minister. Tory chief whip Julian Smith has said that the parliamentary arithmetic means a “softer type of Brexit” is inevitable. The result of the vote is not binding on the government. But the PM will come under intense political pressure to adopt whatever parliament decides. David Gauke, the justice secretary, warned on Sunday that it would not be “sustainable” for May to ignore the will of parliament.  The MPs behind the plan have warned if May ignores the vote, parliament will move to change the law to give her no choice. John Bercow, the Speaker of the Commons, will choose from the list below which will be put to a vote at 8 p.m. BST (3 p.m. ET). Motion A: Unilateral right of exit from the backstop. Tory lawmakers, led by John Baron, want the UK to leave the European Union on May 22, 2019, with the Withdrawal Agreement amended to allow the UK unilaterally to exit the controversial Northern Ireland backstop. Motion B: No deal in the absence of a Withdrawal Agreement. Another proposal from Baron, which calls for a no-deal Brexit on April 12 if no Withdrawal Agreement can be agreed by the Commons. Motion C: Customs union. Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke’s customs union plan requires any Brexit deal to include, as a minimum, a commitment to negotiate a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU”. This was defeated by the smallest margin in the first round, falling just six votes short. Motion D: Common market 2.0. Put forth by Conservatives Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Dame Caroline Spelman and Labour’s Stephen Kinnock, Lucy Powell plus the Scottish National Party’s (SNP) Stewart Hosie. The motion proposes UK membership of the European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area. It allows continued participation in the single market and a “comprehensive customs arrangement” with the EU after Brexit – including a “UK say” on future EU trade deals – would remain in place until the agreement of a wider trade deal which guarantees frictionless movement of goods and an open border in Ireland. Motion E: Confirmatory public vote. It has been drawn up by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson. This motion would require a public vote to confirm any Brexit deal passed by Parliament before its ratification. This option, put forward last time by Labour former minister Dame Margaret Beckett, polled the highest number of votes although was defeated by 295 votes to 268. Motion F: Public vote to prevent no deal. Moved by Labour’s Graham Jones and Tory former minister Dominic Grieve, this proposal would require a referendum, if necessary, to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Motion G: Parliamentary supremacy. SNP MP Joanna Cherry joins with Grieve and MPs from other parties with this plan to seek an extension to the Brexit process, and if this is not possible then Parliament will choose between either no-deal or revoking Article 50. An inquiry would follow to assess the future relationship likely to be acceptable to Brussels and have majority support in the UK. Motion H: Efta and EEA. A motion put forward by Conservative MP George Eustice – who quit as agriculture minister to fight for Brexit – proposes rejoining the European Free Trade Association (Efta) at the “earliest opportunity”, agree a short extension to the UK’s membership of the EU to conclude accession to Efta and negotiate with the EU additional protocols relating to the Northern Ireland border and agri-food trade. If at first, second and third you don’t succeed — give it another bash. On Friday, MPs rejected the prime minister’s latest attempt to push a version of her deal through. But it looks like she is gearing up for another swing later this week.  In theory, a Commons majority for a soft Brexit in the indicative votes could actually help the PM. Downing Street will hope it will scare the remaining hardcore pro-Brexit Tory MPs who oppose the PM into finally backing her deal as the least worst option.  To add to the pressure on Tory MPs, May has hinted she might be prepared to go for the nuclear option of trying to hold a general election to try and break the impasse. Even though that did not go very well for her last time. “I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House,” the PM told the Commons last week. Deputy party chairman James Cleverly upped the ante on Sunday when he declared “sensible and pragmatic” preparations were under way in case the government was forced to go to the country early. Alistair Burt, the former Foreign Office minister who resigned from the government last week to back the indicative votes, summed up the mood of many backbenchers. “I am with Brenda from Bristol on this, ‘Oh no, not another one!’", "date": "2019-04-01", "dateIndex": 0, "subtitle": "Here we go again.", "title": "Explained: Today's Brexit 'Indicative Votes' And What Happens Next", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brexit-what-happens-next-and-todays-indicative-votes-explained_n_5ca2114be4b00ba632805434", "keywordObjects": [{"keyword": "vote", "weight": 0.016666988}, {"keyword": "deal", "weight": 0.015476483}, {"keyword": "brexit", "weight": 0.015476481}, {"keyword": "motion", "weight": 0.014285975}, {"keyword": "this", "weight": 0.013095466}, {"keyword": "will", "weight": 0.0119049605}, {"keyword": "with", "weight": 0.009523949}, {"keyword": "minister", "weight": 0.009523949}, {"keyword": "from", "weight": 0.008333442}, {"keyword": "common", "weight": 0.008333442}]}]
